Welcome to my home on GitHub. Here you'll find repositories related to both my professional work and personal hobbies.

#### OpenJDK

I work at Oracle on [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net), where I contribute to the [JDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk). I have also developed a VS Code extension to support OpenJDK development: [vscode-openjdk-devel](https://github.com/magicus/vscode-openjdk-devel).

#### Minecraft

I like playing Minecraft, but I *love* coding for it. ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™ve created several mods:
 * [Status Effect Timer](https://github.com/magicus/statuseffecttimer): overlays a timer on the Vanilla status effect HUD icons
 * [Mod Settings](https://github.com/magicus/ModSettings): provides an easy-to-access configuration screen for all installed mods
 * [Elytra Indicators](https://github.com/magicus/ElytraIndicators): provides Vanilla-style "fly by instrument" support for elytra flight

Iâ€™m also the Lead Developer and a main contributor to [Wynntils](https://github.com/magicus/Wynntils) â€” a must-have mod for [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/), the worldâ€™s largest Minecraft MMORPG.

Another popular tool is [pmanvil-converter](https://github.com/magicus/pmanvil-converter), which converts Bedrock Edition worlds created by PocketMine to Nukkit format.

#### Other Tools

Some of my other specialized utilities include:
* [pppp-dissector](https://github.com/magicus/pppp-dissector): a Wireshark dissector for the PPPP protocol
* [playgrabber](https://github.com/magicus/playgrabber): downloads videos from svtplay.se
* [icecc-indicator](https://github.com/magicus/icecc-indicator): an AppIndicator monitor for icecc/icecream 

#### Archives

I like to preserve historical codebases. Some projects Iâ€™ve rescued include:
 * [phoneME](https://github.com/magicus/phoneME): the open-source Java ME implementation by Sun
 * [OpenKOM](https://github.com/magicus/OpenKOM): a versatile, terminal-based social community platform
