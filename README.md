### magicus @ GitHub

Welcome to my home in GitHub. Here you will find repos connected to both my work and my hobbies.

#### OpenJDK

I am working for Oracle on [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net), where I contribute to the [JDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk). I have also developed a VS Code extension to support OpenJDK development, [vscode-openjdk-devel](https://github.com/magicus/vscode-openjdk-devel).

#### Minecraft

I like playing Minecraft, both by myself and with my kids, but I love coding for Minecraft. ðŸ˜ƒ I have created three mods:
 * [Status Effect Timer](https://github.com/magicus/statuseffecttimer), which shows a Vanilla-style countdown on Status Effect icons
 * [Mod Settings](https://github.com/magicus/ModSettings), a lightweight alternative to Mod Menu for a Forge-style mod settings screen
 * [Elytra Indicators](https://github.com/magicus/ElytraIndicators), which provides Vanilla-style "fly by instrument" support for elytra flight

I am the Lead Developer of and a main contributor to [Wynntils](https://github.com/magicus/Wynntils), which is a must-have addition for playing on [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/), the worlds largest Minecraft MMORPG.

I have also written [pmanvil-converter](https://github.com/magicus/pmanvil-converter), which converts Bedrock Edition worlds created by PocketMine to Nukkit format, and is surprisingly still very popular.

#### Other Tools

I have also created the following specialized tools:
* [pppp-dissector](https://github.com/magicus/pppp-dissector), a WireShark dissector for the PPPP protocol
* [playgrabber](https://github.com/magicus/playgrabber), which downloads videos from svtplay.se
* [icecc-indicator](https://github.com/magicus/icecc-indicator), an AppIndicator monitor for icecc/icecream 

#### Archives

I like to preserve historical code. I have rescued:
 * [phoneME](https://github.com/magicus/phoneME), the open source Java ME implementation by Sun
 * [OpenKOM](https://github.com/magicus/OpenKOM), a versatile, terminal-based social community platform
