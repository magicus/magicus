### magicus @ GitHub

Welcome to my place in GitHub. Here you will find repos connected to both my work and my hobbies.

#### OpenJDK

I am working for Oracle on [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net), where I contribute to the [JDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) and the [Skara project](https://github.com/openjdk/skara). In my spare time, I have also developed a VS Code extension to support OpenJDK development, [vscode-openjdk-devel](https://github.com/magicus/vscode-openjdk-devel).

#### Minecraft

I like playing Minecraft, both by myself and with my kids, but I love coding for Minecraft. :-) My most popular Minecraft repo is [pmanvil-converter](https://github.com/magicus/pmanvil-converter), which converts Bedrock Edition worlds created by PocketMine to Nukkit format.

I have created two mods:
 * [Status Effect Timer](https://github.com/magicus/statuseffecttimer), which shows a Vanilla-style countdown on Status Effect icons
 * [Mod Settings](https://github.com/magicus/ModSettings), a lightweight alternative to Mod Menu for a Forge-style mod settings screen

I have also made significant contributions to [Wynntils](https://github.com/magicus/Wynntils), which is a must-have addition for playing on [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/), the worlds largest Minecraft MMORPG. Furthermore, I am the Lead Developer of [Artemis](https://github.com/magicus/Artemis), which is a complete rewrite of Wynntils for Minecraft 1.19+.

#### Other Tools

I have also created:
* [playgrabber](https://github.com/magicus/playgrabber), which downloads videos from svtplay.se
* [icecc-indicator](https://github.com/magicus/icecc-indicator), an AppIndicator monitor for icecc/icecream 

#### Archives

I like to preserve historical code. I have rescued:
 * [phoneME](https://github.com/magicus/phoneME), the open source Java ME implementation by Sun
 * [OpenKOM](https://github.com/magicus/OpenKOM), a versatile, terminal-based social community platform
