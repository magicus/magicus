### magicus @ GitHub

Welcome to my place in GitHub. Here you will find repos connected to both my work and my hobbies.

#### OpenJDK

I am working for Oracle on OpenJDK, where I contribute to the JDK, which underpins most of the Java implementations in the world, and also the Skara project, which provides build and development support for OpenJDK. In my spare time, I have also developed a VS Code extension to support OpenJDK development, vscode-openjdk-devel.

#### Minecraft

I like playing Minecraft, both by myself and with my kids, but I love coding for Minecraft. :-) My most popular repo is pmanvil-converter, which converts Bedrock Edition worlds created by PocketMine to Nukkit format.

I have created two mods:
 * Status Effect Timer, which shows a Vanilla-style countdown on Status Effect icons
 * Mod Settings, a lightweight alternative to Mod Menu for a Forge-style mod settings screen

I have also made significant contributions to these mods:
 * Wynntils, a must-have addition for playing on Wynncraft, the worlds largest Minecraft MMORPG
 * JustMap, an highly customable, open source minimap/worldmap mod
 * ProtocolSupport, working with the Bedrock/Java Edition interoperability once present in this mod

#### Other Tools

I have also created:
* playgrabber, which downloads videos from svtplay.se
* icecc-indicator, an AppIndicator monitor for icecc/icecream 

#### Archives

I like to preserve historical code. I have rescued:
 * phoneME, the open source Java ME implementation by Sun
 * OpenKOM, a versatile, terminal-based social community platform
